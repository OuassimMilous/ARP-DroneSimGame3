## ARP SECOND ASSIGNMENT

## Short Definitions of Active Components:

#    Master (master.c):
        Purpose: Creates the shared memory and the semaphores and it forks the processes and launches the other active components.
        Primitives Used: Shared memory, semaphores, file operations, fork.

#   Server (server.c):
        Purpose: Manages shared memory and logs drone positions.
        Primitives Used: Shared memory, semaphores, file operations.

#    UI (ui.c):
        Purpose: Uses ncurses to display the drone position and UI messages.
        Primitives Used: Shared memory, semaphores, ncurses.

#    Keyboard (keyboard.c):
        Purpose: Captures keyboard input and sends it to the drone through a FIFO.
        Primitives Used: Shared memory, semaphores, FIFO.

#    Drone (drone.c):
        Purpose: Simulates a drone's movement based on keyboard input.
        Primitives Used: Shared memory, semaphores.
        
 #    Targets (targets.c):
        Purpose: Creates Targets and checks wether they were reached yet.
        Primitives Used: Shared memory, semaphores.
        
 #    Obstacles (obstacles.c):
        Purpose: Creates obstacles and keeps on changing their position every now and then
        Primitives Used: Shared memory, semaphores.

#    Watchdog (watchdog.c):
        Purpose: Monitors the status of all processes and logs them.
        Primitives Used: Shared memory, semaphores.


## List of Components, Directories, Files:

  #  Directories:

        log/: Contains log files.
        /: Contains source code files.

  #  Files:
      	master.c: Main program.
        server.c: Server component.
        ui.c: UI component.
        keyboard.c: Keyboard component.
        drone.c: Drone component.
        watchdog.c: Watchdog component.
        constants.h: Header file with constant values.
        Makefile: Build automation file.
        readme.md: Documentation file.

## Instructions for Installing and Running:

  #  Installation:
        Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (ncurses).
        Compile the components using make (Execute "make" on the root directory). 
        ps: if you cloned it from github you might need to execute "mkdir build" before building the project.

   # Running:
    ```
    ./build/master.
    ```

## Operational Instructions:

  #  UI Window:
        Displays the drone's position and coordinates.
        No user interaction; visualizes the drone's movement.

  #  Keyboard Window:
        Press keys to control the drone's movement.
        Logs keypresses.


  #  Watchdog Window:
        Monitors and logs the status of all processes.\
        

## Control Keys:

  #  W (Move Up):
        Increments the upward force on the drone, simulating an upward movement.

  #  A (Move Left):
        Decrements the horizontal force on the drone, simulating a leftward movement.

  #  S (Move Down):
        Decrements the downward force on the drone, simulating a downward movement.

  #  D (Move Right):
        Increments the horizontal force on the drone, simulating a rightward movement.

  #  Q (Move Up-Left):
        Simultaneously decrements horizontal force and increments upward force.

  #  E (Move Up-Right):
        Simultaneously increments horizontal force and increments upward force.

  #  Z (Move Down-Left):
        Simultaneously decrements horizontal force and decrements downward force.

  #  C (Move Down-Right):
        Simultaneously increments horizontal force and decrements downward force.

  #  X (Stop):
        Sets both horizontal and vertical forces to zero, stopping the drone.

  #  ESC (Exit):
        Exits the program.
